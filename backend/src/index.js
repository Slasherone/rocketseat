There are three ways to use parameters within http verbs, as follows:

Query Params: Mainly used with GET (filter and pagination), obtained using => request.query
Route Params: Mainly used with PUT/PATCH (when something is specific, like users/1), obtained using => request.params
Request Body: Mainly used with POST (to create or edit a resource), obtained using => request.body --- JSON format is a standard for it's usage (like SISREG stuff I do with Python at work using requests/elasticsearch)

/*
Middleware: Interceptor of requests that can completely INTERRUPT it or CHANGE data within a request.
These can be used to VALIDATE actions as well.

There are 3 main ways of using it:
1) Through app.use(xxxx) (which is global, meaning every route will have use it, xxxx being the name of the function)
2) Through app.use(specifyARoute/) (which every route that has the same specified path will use it, i.e. xxxx)
3) Through direct specification, as a parameter of a route, i.e. app.get('/projects', MIDDLEWARE_NAME_HERE, (request, response) => {} ...

Routes can be classified as a middleware (get/post/put/delete/etc) for educational purposes,
However proper "Middlewares" are declared with a "next" parameter which helps to identificate it (exemple down below at code)

    const logLabel = `[${method.toUpperCase()}] ${url}`; // `` allows to use variables within strings, similar to Python's f"".

    console.time(logLabel); // Similar to the stuff I do with time module in Python to control program speed. This prints logLabel (above)

    next(); // This executes the "normal" route (for example, app.get)

    console.timeEnd(logLabel); // Complement to the action above, this prints how long it took (from start to finish of action)
}

// Middleware (function) to validate if given Id is valid in uuid format

yarn init -y
# iniates the project within the actual directory (similar to Python's virtualenv)

yarn add express
# adds the express package (similar to Python's pip)
# express module is a light framework for web dev. It serves as a server, with many uses involving http requests.

yarn add nodemon -D
# adds the nodemon package, which restarts the server after each save (easier to see changes)
# -D flag only adds the package to the development machine (if deployed to production, nodemon won't be added automatically)

yarn dev
# following the tip above, a snippet was created inside package.json to use nodemon in a different manner
# using the scripts{} notation inside the file, the snippet was given the name dev and we can call it by the command yarn dev
# yarn looks for "dev" inside the file, which in this case states the use of nodemon, which in this case looks towards the "main" inside the package.json file (set to src/index.js) 
# In another words, behind the scenes, yarn dev == nodemon src/inde.js
