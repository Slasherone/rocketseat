There are three ways to use parameters within http verbs, as follows:

Query Params: Mainly used with GET (filter and pagination), obtained using => request.query
Route Params: Mainly used with PUT/PATCH (when something is specific, like users/1), obtained using => request.params
Request Body: Mainly used with POST (to create or edit a resource), obtained using => request.body --- JSON format is a standard for it's usage (like SISREG stuff I do with Python at work using requests/elasticsearch)

/*

yarn init -y
# iniates the project within the actual directory (similar to Python's virtualenv)

yarn add express
# adds the express package (similar to Python's pip)
# express module is a light framework for web dev. It serves as a server, with many uses involving http requests.

yarn add nodemon -D
# adds the nodemon package, which restarts the server after each save (easier to see changes)
# -D flag only adds the package to the development machine (if deployed to production, nodemon won't be added automatically)

yarn dev
# following the tip above, a snippet was created inside package.json to use nodemon in a different manner
# using the scripts{} notation inside the file, the snippet was given the name dev and we can call it by the command yarn dev
# yarn looks for "dev" inside the file, which in this case states the use of nodemon, which in this case looks towards the "main" inside the package.json file (set to src/index.js) 
# In another words, behind the scenes, yarn dev == nodemon src/inde.js
